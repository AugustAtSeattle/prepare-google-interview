following expression is useful in bit manipulation. We use "1s" and "0s" to indicate a sequence of 1s or 0s, respectively.


- x^x = 0s
- x^0s = x
- x^1s = ~x

- x|0s = x
- x|1s = 1s
- x|x = x

- x&0s = 0
- x&x = x
- x&1s = x


PS.  
-'^' means difference set 1 or set 0
-'&' means AND 
-'~' means reverse all bits
-'|' means OR
