- I am rusty on [C++]
- For simplicity, assume that [there are four-bit numbers]
- If you get confused, I'll try to explain it in a different way.
- I'm not sure I can recall the answer, but let me see if I can figure it out. Suppose we have this code...

- recall that
- impact sth
- sequence of

- Though this algorithm is not as optimal in some senses, it may be preferable in one sense: it's clean, simple and easy to understand. In a practical sense, this may be a superior way to implement the problem.
- However if efficiency is very important, we can implement it a different way.
