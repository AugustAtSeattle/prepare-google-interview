//Given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
//Write a method to set all bits between i and j in N equal to M
//(e g , M becomes a substring of N located at i and starting at j)
//
//Example
//Given N=(10000000000)2, M=(10101)2, i=2, j=6
//
//return N=(10001010100)2
//
//Note
//In the function, the numbers N and M will given in decimal,
//you should also return a decimal number.
//
//Challenge
//Minimum number of operations?
//
//Clarification
//You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M.
//That is, if M=10011ï¼Œ
//you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.
//You would not, for example, have j=3 and i=2,
//because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
