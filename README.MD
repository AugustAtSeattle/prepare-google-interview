### Why am I writing these articles.
- For dream. I am dreaming about working at Google
- For self supervision. It makes me work efficiently and effectively. 
<br/>(ps. efficient means doing things right, effective means doing right things).
- For story. I would like to tell a story. Hey folks, I have done these before, even I fail, but so much fun.
